# NUMPY
<p> Numpy is a library helps in doing all the scientific calculation. <br/>
The default data-type of numpy is an array. <br/>
It helps in manuplating the data of matrix and array.</br>
we can create an array using numpy by using <strong> numpy.array() </strong> and <strong> numpy.arange() </strong> function. </br>
we can check the dimension of array, matrix by "numpy.ndim. </br>
check the shape of array and matrix using 'numpy.shape'. </br>
we can easily perform arthematic operation on array and matrix using numpy. </br>
we can also create a matrix of higher dimnesion using the numpy. </br>
